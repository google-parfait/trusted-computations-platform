//! This module expresses a simple abstraction layer between the trusted host and
//! trusted application it runs. The main goal is to abstract away details of the
//! trusted hosting and support mutiple host implementations. The host implementations
//! differ in their capabilities with some imposing significant restrictions but
//! offering better security and privacy guarantees. Hence the abstraction layer
//! focuses on the most restricted host and assumes restricted kernel.
//!
//! Restricted kernel limits the execution model to processing signals (or rather
//! messages) received from the untrusted launcher over a communication channel. Given
//! this limitation the abstraction layer assumes that the trusted application performs
//! processing in response to the signal from the untrusted launcher which can be
//! either a message or a clock tick. In other words the abstraction layer defines
//! a poll based execution model driven by a signal generating loop in untrusted
//! launcher.
//!
//! [Application] trait must be implemented by a concrete trusted application to
//! receive signals from the trusted host originating from untrusted launcher.
//!
//! [Host] trait must be implemented by a concrete trusted host to expose its capabilities
//! to the trusted application.
